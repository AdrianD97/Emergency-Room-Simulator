		#  Emergency Room Simulator, university project

	The application simulates an emergency room system.
	The simulation takes place in rounds.

	The project is implemented in Java. To implement it, I have
	used the observer design pattern.

	Program testing is done automatically by running the checker.sh script.
	The goal of the poo_checks.xml and checkstyle-7.3-all.jar files is to identify
	places in the code that may be in non-compliance with google style.
